Hi There!

This is going to be a folder where I will be messing around with some concepts of AI.

My overall interest is to great a program that will be able to solve problems such as finding resources in an unfamiliar environment and bringing them back to a centralized hive. 

But first, we are going to start off with some of the more basic stuff, like maze solving.
